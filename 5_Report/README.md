# REPORT GENERATION
## INTRODUCTION
   * This project is basically a combined project that can run random programs
     that has been build into the c code of the user's choice ,
   * which can even be devoloped further by adding more and more c project files that 
     are made in a single file and that can be linked 
     into the main file of my project and with the little tweaks to the main file 
   * and the file that has ben copies it the added program 
     will become a complete part of my project
     
     
### MAIN FILE
   * This file gets the input from user to determine the 
     program that the user wants to use 
   * and also this file navigates to the files other than the main file depending
     upon the choice given by the user
     
### OTHER FILES
   * other files will be different from each others as these will be the 
     random programs the user will be choosing from and each program will 
     be unique in its own way
   * these files can perform things like addition, subraction,multiplication and so and many
   
    
### individual .h files
    * Snake game:
                 this game will allow you to play the snake and ladder game that you used to play as a child in the digital form. so , you can play this game with two                    players getting bited by snake will let you back to the start point or a point before the present one and the ladders will let you climb higher 
    * Calculator:
                 this calculator program will allow you to calculate addition, subraction, multiplication, dividion and also can find remainder
    * Stopwatch: 
                  this program will let you run stopwatch digitally using c program , and you can even run the stop watch for hours , minutes or seconds as the user                       wishes to use the stopwatch
    * Voting maichine:
                  this machine will have 4 inbuilt leaders and the user will have to vote for any one by circulating this program to many persons they will be giving                     thier vote of opinion and the leader who will win with maximum votes can also determined with this program
                  
                  
### test files
       since i didnt have a lot of input for this program i had very minimal test case scenerious and thus the work done became very small 
         * ssnake game: for the snake game its just the input user gives must be less then 3
         * calculator: the input should not be int max or int min in most cases 
         * Stopwatch : the input must be less than 60 seconds and 60 minutes and also it should not be negative
         * Voting machine: the input must be less than 6 and not more than that not even equal to 6
         
         
# important message
  This will not be the final stage of the project i will be adding every programs that i can add to this project and make it a big project that will have nearly a 100's   of random programs that user will be able to have fun with and i welcome any of the volunteers also to work with my code so you can be a part of this big project that   it might become one day
